# 🧠 Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful image classification model built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model is trained on the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset to classify images of clothing items into one of 10 categories.

---

## 🎯 Aim

Build an image classifier using CNN that can categorize images into predefined classes using a trained deep learning model.

## 📄 Description

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network** to classify grayscale images of clothing (e.g., shirts, shoes, bags) from the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset. The CNN architecture consists of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers that output class predictions using softmax activation.
