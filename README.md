# 🧠 Image Classifier using CNN (Console-based)

This is an image classification project developed using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in Python. It uses the **Fashion MNIST** dataset to classify grayscale images into one of 10 categories such as T-shirts, trousers, and shoes.

The project was created as part of my internship with **CodeClause**, and it helped me gain practical experience with deep learning and image data.
